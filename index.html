				<h2>Hi, I am Mitachie Rokya</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, I'm Mitachie Rokya, a passionate musician, composer, and live performer. My journey with
					music began at a young age, and since then, I've dedicated my life to mastering the guitar and
					piano. Over the years, I’ve developed a unique sound that blends elements of diverse genres, from
					soulful acoustic melodies to intricate piano compositions. My music is deeply personal, often
					inspired by the world around me and the emotions we all share.
					<br><br>
					I’ve composed and produced multiple tracks, and I’m proud to have released my debut album, which
					reflects my evolution as an artist. It’s a blend of heartfelt lyrics, intricate harmonies, and
					powerful instrumental pieces. Beyond studio work, I thrive on stage, where I connect with audiences
					through live performances and gigs, bringing my music to life with an energetic and intimate touch.
					<br><br>
					Whether performing solo or collaborating with other talented musicians, my goal is to create a
					memorable and moving musical experience. Music, to me, is about storytelling, connection, and
					expression, and I can’t wait to share my next chapter with you.
